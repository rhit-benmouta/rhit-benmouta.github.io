        <h2>Rose GPE FSAE EV Car Model</h2>
        <p><strong>Rose GPE (FSAE), Terre Haute, IN | August 2024 – November 2024</strong></p>
        <p>
          Designed predictive & reactive models (using MATLAB & Simulink) of the upcoming electric FSAE vehicle to set goals for design by estimating the required battery capacity, voltage, and motor selection to complete the endurance event. The model can showcase the evolution of energy consumption, state of charge, voltage, torque, and power utilization.

        <h2>Audi Q7 V12 TDI Model</h2>
        <p><strong>Vehicle System Modeling, Terre Haute, IN | October 2024 – November 2024</strong></p>
        <p>
          Designed with another teammate reactive & predictive models (using MATLAB & Simulink) of the Audi Q7 V12 TDI. We were able to model 0-60 acceleration time, maximum torque & horsepower values, city/highway fuel economy and compare the model to real-life data.

        <h2>Autonomous Robot Car</h2>
        <p><strong>Junior Design, Terre Haute, IN | January 2024 – February 2024</strong></p>
        <p>
          Designed with 3 other students an autonomous vehicle for high school students to promote interest in Computer and Electrical Engineering at Rose-Hulman. Implemented track-following software using a PID controller and designed the battery system using supercapacitors, a custom PCB, and a buck-boost converter circuit.

        <h2>Automotive IR Temperature Sensor</h2>
        <p><strong>Rose GPE (FSAE), Terre Haute, IN | September 2022 – November 2023</strong></p>
        <p>
          Designed multiple iterations of a PCB with a custom power supply to monitor tire and brake rotor temperatures using an IR thermal sensor array (I2C). Data is transmitted to the vehicle’s CAN bus.

        <h2>Single-Core Processor</h2>
        <p><strong>Computer Architecture I, Terre Haute, IN | January 2023 – February 2023</strong></p>
        <p>
          Designed a 16-bit processor using Verilog & ModelSim, inspired by RISC-V architecture. The processor featured 16 registers and supported basic programs loaded from external memory. A custom assembler was implemented as an extra feature.

        <h2>Tire Temperature Monitoring System</h2>
        <p><strong>Introduction to Embedded Systems, Terre Haute, IN | February 2023</strong></p>
        <p>
          Developed an embedded system using an IR temperature array sensor to display tire temperature on a grayscale LED matrix. If the temperature exceeded a threshold, a water pump system was triggered to cool the tire. Implemented I2C and SPI communication, and designed 3D-printed housing for the full system.

        <h2>Stepper Motors Driver</h2>
        <p><strong>Introduction to Embedded Systems, Terre Haute, IN | January 2023</strong></p>
        <p>
          Created a stepper motor driver controlled via analog input, with a servo-based speed gauge. Utilized PWM, interrupts, timers, and analog sensors with an MSP432 Launchpad.
